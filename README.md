#### Hello! :wave:

###### This is my first PHP web project.
a project based on a object oriented PHP with a connection to a database. The project presents a page that allows you to log in to the system of a sample database of scientific articles. The user after the correct login or registration has the ability to search, edit articles, add own content, and read the information about the authors.

**Technologies: (I wanted to keep this project pretty basic.) **
- PHP 7.2
- PHP Object oriented PDO 
- HTML, CSS

Written program is "ready to use", you can run it on XAMPP, or winNMP server.

**How to use instructions: (GUI is in Polish)**
1. After entering the website, to create a new account, enter the login and password, and then press the "Zarejestruj u≈ºytkownika" (Register user) button.
2. Then you can log in to the newly created account, by entering the login and password again, and pressing the "Zaloguj" (Login) button.
3. After correct login, the "pop-up" with the title "ciasteczko" (cookie) on the right side of the screen should display the content of the cookie created after logging in.
4. Then, the program allows browsing, adding, deleting, articles and authors.
